# simrouting

simrouting is a routing algorithm simulator
that I was playing around with,
in my student era of 2007-2008,
and in my JAIST era of 2008-2010.

It contains the implementations of Dijkstra, reverse version of Dijkstra,
and MARA which made it to IEEE INFOCOM 2009.
The pre-print is [here](https://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~rdv/publications/ohara-mara-infocom09.pdf).

```
lib/routing/dijkstra.c: Dijkstra
lib/routing/reverse-dijkstra.c: reverse version of Dijkstra
lib/routing/mara-spe.c: MARA-SPE
```

The paper draft of this simulator was not published (I gave up).
The draft is in doc/.
